# Rules

## Communication
- Avoid unnecessary exchanges such as "You are right," "As you say," or "Sorry, I will fix it immediately."
- Communicate concisely and focus on essential information only.

## Docker
- When waiting for docker containers to start up, limit sleep duration to a maximum of 5 seconds.
